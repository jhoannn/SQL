#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer, employee, artist, and order data. 

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
SELECT customerid, firstname, lastname, country FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'USA'

#2.Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT firstname, lastname FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country is 'Brazil'

#3.Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT firstname, lastname, invoiceid, invoicedate, billingcountry FROM chinook.customers AS cust
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv
ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid
WHERE country is 'Brazil'

#4.Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title = 'Sales Support Agent'

#5.Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT billingcountry FROM chinook.invoices

#6.Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.firstname, emp.lastname, inv.invoiceid FROM chinook.customers AS cust
JOIN chinook.employees AS emp
ON cust.supportrepid = emp.employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv
ON cust.customerid = inv.customerid
ORDER BY emp.employeeid

#7.Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT total, cust.firstname, cust.lastname , cust.country, emp.firstname, emp.lastname
FROM chinook.customers AS cust
JOIN chinook.employees AS emp
ON cust.supportrepid = emp.employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv
ON cust.customerid = inv.customerid
